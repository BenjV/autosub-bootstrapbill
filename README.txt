Make sure you have python installed. Also you need the python-cheetah package:

 * Download the zip file from our download section
 * Unzip the file, change to the directory where AutoSub.py is located
 * Start the script: "python AutoSub.py"
 * A webbrowser should now open
 * Go to the config page, check the settings, make sure you set atleast: path 
(Should point to the location where AutoSub.py is located. Seriespath (Should point to the root of your series folder)
 * Shutdown AutoSub and start it again
Enjoy your subtitles!

Requirements for running AutoSub:
- Install Cheetah : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cheetah/2.4.4
- Python2.7

For Synology users use python from the SynoCommunity this has cheetah already included

You can use a version lower than python2.7 but as an additional dependency, you have to install
the python html5lib module: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib/1.0b3
